Welcome! 

## What's This All About?
This repository is motivated by [esthrncode](https://github.com/esthrncode/euler_applications/blob/main/README.md?plain=1).

Every day, I acquire new knowledge, sometimes through problem-solving in research, teaching, or simply indulging in hobbies like coding for pleasure. Usually, these acquired ideas tend to fade over time. I've begun documenting my ideas here, intending to refine them. This way, whenever I need them, I can easily retrieve and utilize them.

## Why I Made This

- **To Remember**: It functions as a sort of diary, capturing all the ideas and problems I've solved, along with the lessons I've gleaned from them.
- **To Connect**: The beauty of math and many other things in life. I found that Mathematics is pervasive across numerous domains.
- **To Help**: First of all, to help myself. I want to train myself to "think by writing," as it is easily more productive and systematic than merely keeping ideas in my mind and repeatedly exploring an unprocessed idea, one that I have not worked on deeply. I believe we should not repeat things; life is too short to keep revisiting something without gaining new results.

Furthermore, it might capture someone's interest.

## What You'll Find Here

For each idea or problem I've worked on, there's a note. Sometimes, I collect ideas or topics I find fascinating but haven't had time to explore yet. In such cases, I outline what I think and what I want to investigate.

 Let's keep exploring and learning together (copied from [esthrncode](https://github.com/esthrncode)).
